<li>We guarantee we will not sell or distribute any personal information you share with us.</li>
<li>We will not send you unsolicited email.</li>
<li>We will gladly show you the personal data we store about you in order to run the website.</li>

<p>If you have problems unsubscribing, you can contact us on <a href="mailto:support@theyworkforyou.com">support@theyworkforyou.com</a>.</p>

<h3>What is your cookie policy?</h3>
<p>We use cookies to save you from having to repeatedly sign in to the site, and also to remember your postcode. We may also use them to record if you've answered one of the survey questions we ask. The site will work with cookies disabled, but it won't be as good.</p>

<h3>What are these survey questions?</h3>
<p>In order to improve the site we're asking some questions to help us understand who uses the site and what they want. The answers are completely anonymous.</p>

<h3>What data do you collect about me?</h3>
<p>We use Extreme DB and Google Analytics to track aggregated traffic through the website.These tools tell us the answers to questions such as: Which search terms bring the most people to the site? What type of page do people spend the most time on, and from what type of page do they generally leave the site? Where might users find it difficult to understand what to click next?</p>

<p>Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason: to help us understand how we can make the site work better for you, our users.</p>
